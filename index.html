                <p>If stress has you anxious, tense and worried, consider trying meditation. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can help restore your calm and inner peace. <br> <br>

                    Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive. And it doesn't require any special equipment. <br> <br>
                    
                    And you can practice meditation wherever you are — whether you're out for a walk, riding the bus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the middle of a difficult business meeting.</p>

                <p>We all know how important exercise is for keeping us physically healthy. But did you know that exercise can also help keep you mentally healthy? <br> <br>

                    Research shows that people who exercise regularly have better mental health and emotional wellbeing, and lower rates of mental illness. </p>

                <h2>Journaling</h2>
                <p>Journaling has long been recognized as an effective way to reduce stress, help with depression and anxiety, focus your mind, and organize your life. It can be a great tool to use for meditation, to open up, and let go of things that bother you. <br> <br> 
                    Research shows that daily journaling can help improve your mental health and get your life back on track, whether you’re struggling with relationships, future goals, how to stay organized, or even in the ways you communicate with a partner, your children, your coworkers, your friends, your parents, or anyone in your life.</p>

                <h2>Healthy diet</h2>
                <p>From a young age, we’re taught that eating well helps us look and feel our physical best. What we’re not always told is that good nutrition significantly affects our mental health, too. A healthy, well-balanced diet can help us think clearly and feel more alert. It can also improve concentration and attention span. <br> <br>
                    Conversely, an inadequate diet can lead to fatigue, impaired decision-making, and can slow down reaction time. In fact, a poor diet can actually aggravate, and may even lead to, stress and depression.
